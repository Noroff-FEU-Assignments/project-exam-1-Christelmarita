This is my Exam Project at the end of my first year as a Front End Development student at Noroff. 

## Description

This was my final project of year one studying Front End Development.
This project was a culmination of what we have learned about HTML, CSS, Javascript, UX, SEO and CMS.
The brief was to create a blog site, fetching posts from WordPress using and api call.
All design is created by me.

Some of the criterias that had to be met were:
- Fetch the posts using api call and display then dynamically.
- The specific blog posts should be created dynamically.
- The index page should have a carousel displaying this latest post.
- The blogs page should list 10 blog posts and have a functional "view more" button to view the rest of the blog posts.
- The images on the blog specific page should be opened as modals on click.
